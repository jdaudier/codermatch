    <h4>Beginner:</h4>
    <p>You finally made friends with the command line and know how to "cd" your way in and out of directories. You just finished a Codecademy track on the language you're trying to learn and know the difference between an array and a hash (or a div and a table in HTML). And you're probably learning how to commit... in Git that is!</p>

    <h4>Intermediate:</h4>
    <p>You've got a few years down your belt as a coder (probably at a VC-backed startup) and have a shipped a few apps in the heydays. And, you've upgraded to Vim, no less. Things are starting to click for you and the mumbo jumbo that once was is starting to make sense. In fact, you've successfully turned into "that guy" or “that girl”. Yes, the one that's laying down the tech mumbo jumbo spiel amongst your friends. You're opinionated, and you must be heard!</p>

    <h4>Advanced:</h4>
    <p>You've been coding since you were &#60;insert age under 14&#62;. You've contributed to lots of open source projects and teach or mentor others how to code on the side (and perhaps even wrote a book or two). You have written code that's being used by thousands of other users whether it be a Ruby Gem or jQuery plugin. When you run into a bug, you are calm and collected. "There's nothing I can't solve," you think to yourself as you type away speedily on your Dvorak keyboard.</p>
